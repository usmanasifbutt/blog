## Introduction  

In modern web applications, certain tasks—like sending emails, processing images, or handling background jobs—can be time-consuming and shouldn't block user requests. This is where **Celery** comes in. Celery is a powerful **distributed task queue** that enables you to process tasks asynchronously using **queues and workers**.

In this post, we'll dive into:
- What Celery is and why it's useful
- How Celery uses **queues** to manage tasks
- The role of **workers** in processing those tasks
- How to set up Celery in a Django project

## What is Celery?  

Celery is an **asynchronous task queue** that allows you to run background jobs in a distributed environment. Instead of running a heavy computation task inside a Django view (blocking the request), you send the task to a queue, and a Celery **worker** picks it up and executes it in the background.

### Why Use Celery?  
- **Improves performance** – Background tasks don’t block the main application.  
- **Handles long-running jobs** – Ideal for tasks like sending emails, generating reports, or processing large datasets.  
- **Supports distributed execution** – You can scale by adding more workers to process tasks in parallel.  
- **Built-in retries** – If a task fails, Celery can automatically retry it based on your configuration.

## How Celery Uses Queues  

A **queue** is a buffer where tasks wait to be executed. Celery sends tasks to message brokers like **RabbitMQ** or **Redis**, which act as intermediaries between the Django app and Celery workers.  

Here's a typical Celery workflow:
1. **Django App** sends a task to Celery.  
2. The task is placed in a **queue** (stored in Redis or RabbitMQ).  
3. A **worker** picks up the task from the queue and processes it.  
4. Once completed, the worker sends back the result (if required).  

### Task Queues in Celery  
Celery supports multiple queues to help prioritize different types of tasks. Some common queue setups:
- **Default queue** – Where all tasks go if no queue is specified.  
- **High-priority queue** – For urgent tasks that need immediate processing.  
- **Low-priority queue** – For background tasks that can wait.  
- **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** – For failed tasks that need manual inspection.  

In Django, you can configure Celery to route tasks to specific queues based on task type.

## Celery Workers: Processing Tasks  

A **worker** is a process that listens for incoming tasks from a queue and executes them. You can run multiple workers on different servers to **scale processing power**.

To start a worker, use:  
{% highlight python %}
celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info
{% endhighlight %}
